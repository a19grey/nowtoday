# Created Development Branch for Experimental Changes

- Created a new 'dev' branch to safely store and experiment with recent changes
- This includes updates to port configuration and other modifications
- Main branch remains untouched until changes are finalized and ready for merging
- Now it works after restarting the server.

Working. Needed to reset everthing. Some extra npm servers stuck running. 

#First entry
