## 2023-04-20: Updated pyproject.toml and Dependencies

- Updated `pyproject.toml` to include all necessary dependencies
- Added requests, jina, and openai to the project dependencies
- Ensured consistency between `pyproject.toml` and `poetry.lock`

## 2023-04-20: Poetry Configuration Verification

- Learned how to check which `pyproject.toml` file Poetry is using
- Used `poetry env info` command to display Poetry environment information
- Documented the process for future reference

## 2023-04-20: Troubleshooting Poetry Virtual Environment

- Encountered issues with Poetry not detecting a virtual environment

- Outlined steps for deactivating existing environments and creating new ones
- Emphasized the importance of using clean, project-specific virtual environments

## 2023-04-20: Regenerated poetry.lock File

- Used `poetry lock --no-update` command to regenerate the poetry.lock file based on pyproject.toml
- Ensured that the project dependencies are correctly locked and in sync with the project specifications
- Maintained consistency between pyproject.toml and poetry.lock files

## 2023-04-20: Updated Dependencies with Poetry

- Ran `poetry lock` to generate/update the `poetry.lock` file
- Learned the distinction between `poetry lock` (which updates the lock file) and `poetry install` (which installs packages)
- Prepared to run `poetry install` to actually install the resolved dependencies

## 2023-04-20: Resolved Import Issues
